        <p>
            In this image, the "Play Free Now" button is a strong contrast to the background images color, enticing the user's view to focus on it.

        <h3>Emphasis and Contrast</h3>
        <div class="company-name">Blizzard</div>
        <a href="https://starcraft2.com/en-us/">starcraft2.com</a>

        <p>
            In this image, the videos are emphasised from the previous images by providing a strong border around their edges, implying that there is a different function to them than the images previously. The brighter border around the thumbnails of the images, along with the static "play" icon in the center of them really set them apart from being mistaken as something to be skipped.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <p>
            In this image, I noticed that the social media icons are all aligned to allow for space between each one, as well as being in columns that keep them in a pleasing formation.
